                1.1. These general terms and conditions of sale (“General Terms”) describe the terms on which BALENCIAGA AMERICA INC.
                a New York DEL CORP – Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business located at 65 Bleecker Street 3rd Floor 10012

                through the website https://www.balenciaga.com/us/ (“Website”).
            </p>
            <p>1.2. These General Terms will apply to any contract for the sale of Products by BALENCIAGA to you through the Website (“Contract”).</p>
            <p>
                1.3. The sale of Products under these General Terms is only available to consumers, meaning natural persons who act for purposes of
                personal consumption (i.e. for purposes extraneous to their trade, business, craft and profession and not for profit),
                who have reached the age of majority and have full legal capacity to enter into a Contract, in their country.
            </p>
            <p>
                1.4. You will be asked to agree to these General Terms and to the Terms of Use of the Website (“ToU”) before placing an order.
                We therefore advise you to read these documents carefully, and in particular these General Terms,
                before proceeding with any purchase, and save or print a copy for future reference. If you do not agree to these General Terms,
                the ToU, and our Privacy Policy, you will not be able to order any Products from the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
                1.5. We reserve the right to amend or update all or part of these General Terms from time to time, without notice.
                Any amendments or updates we make to these General Terms will apply to any future orders you place with us when ordering Products.
                We will always post the most current version of these General Terms on the Website and display the ”Last Updated”
                date to reflect the date of the changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                1.6. These General Terms should be read alongside, and are in addition to, our Privacy Policy at
                https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/legal-notices/privacy-policy/privacy-policy.html which tells you how we use your personal data,
                and our Cookie Policy at https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/legal-notices/cookie-policy/cookie-policy.html.
            </p>

                2. PRODUCTS INFORMATION AND AVAILABILITY
                2.1. Information on our Products (along with the corresponding Product codes) and relevant prices are available on the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.2. The Products available on the Website are usually a selection of items normally available in stores.
                However certain Products may be available exclusively online through the Website, and others may not be available, or legally sold,
                online. Also, some Products may not be shipped to your country.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.3. Pictures of the Products displayed on the Website are for illustrative purposes only.
                Although we have made every effort to display the Products accurately,
                we cannot guarantee that a device’s display of our Products accurately reflects them. In particular, the colors, fabric, shade, grain,
                texture of the Products shown on your screen may vary from those on the actual Product.
                Therefore, you should rely exclusively on the description of the Products and their characteristics as mentioned on the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.4. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit the quantities and/or types of any Products available on the Website per person,
                household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same account,
                the same payment method and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address.
                You cannot purchase more than two (2) identical Products per order. The maximum number of items per order is ten (10).
            </p>
            <p>
                2.5. We may change or discontinue a Product or any of its features, as described on the Website, at any time without
                notice (this does not affect orders already placed at the time of the change). During the purchasing process,
                we will inform you if your order cannot be processed due to the unavailability of the ordered Products.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.6. In the event your connection to the Website fails, your selection of Products may be lost.
                In such case you will be required to re-enter your selection. Please note that Products in your shopping cart are not reserved and
                may be purchased by other customers. In no event we shall be liable to you for the unavailability of a Product following a failure or
                loss of your connection to the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. PRICES
                3.1. Prices of Products are indicated on the Website in Euro and are inclusive of any applicable VAT, sales taxes or other taxes.
                Prices do not include delivery charges, which, if any, shall be added to the price of the Products and will be communicated
                to you during the checkout process before you confirm your order.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.2. We make all reasonable efforts to ensure that all prices for the Products displayed on the Website are correct.
                Occasionally, however, an error may occur, and Products may be mispriced (incorrect price or typographical error in the price shown).
                In this case we will, at our discretion,
                (i) cancel the order or terminate the Contract (depending on when the error is detected)
                and notify you of such cancellation or termination, or
                (ii) contact you and ask you whether you wish to purchase the Product at the correct price.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.3. We reserve the right to change the Products prices at any time and without notice,
                but such changes will not apply to Products for which you have received an Order Acceptance.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. FORMATION OF THE CONTRACT – PLACING AN ORDER
                4.1. The information about the Products and their prices that is displayed on the Website does not represent an offer by us.
            </p>
            <p>
                4.2. To purchase Products on the Website, you must follow the instructions provided by the online purchase process:
                (i) include the selected Products (subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.4) in the shopping cart,
                (ii) fill in the order form with your personal information (name, address, email, telephone, shipping/billing address),
                (iii) select your payment method,
                (iv) accept these General Terms,
                (v) accept the ToU and
                (vi) place your order through the Website (following the relevant instructions on screen).
            </p>
            <p>4.3. Before submitting your order, you will be given the opportunity to review your selection, check the total price and correct any errors.</p>
            <p>
                4.4. Your order constitutes an offer to purchase from us the selected Products, under these General Terms. By placing an order,
                you agree to pay the price of the ordered Products.
            </p>
            <p>
                4.5. All orders submitted by you are subject to our acceptance. Once you place your order,
                we will acknowledge it by email (“ Order Confirmation”). This Order Confirmation does not, however,
                mean that your order has been accepted. We may choose not to accept your order, in whole or in part, without liability to you.
                Examples of non-acceptance of your orders are as follows:
                (i) The Products are not available; or
                (ii) You do not comply with the eligibility conditions set out in Section 1.3; or
                (iii) You have ordered too many Products (see Section 2.4); or
                (iv) We are unable to obtain authorization for your payment; or
                (v) There is an error in the price displayed; or
                (vi) Reported or suspected, fraudulent, illegal or unauthorized activities, including suspected purchases for commercial purposes; or
                (vii) The delivery address provided by you is not a valid address; or
                (viii) You have not fulfilled your obligations deriving from a prior contract entered into with us.
            </p>
            <p>
                4.6. The Contract between us and you will only be formed when you receive from us an email notification confirming shipment of
                your order (" Order Acceptance"). The Order Acceptance (or rejection) shall be sent to the email address provided by you in the order.
                The details of your accepted orders are available under “My Account - My Order” section of the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
                4.7. In case of unavailability of one or more ordered Products, we will contact you and inform you of such unavailability.
                The order will be partially cancelled and you shall pay only the price of the available Product(s).
            </p>
            <p>
                4.8. The Order Confirmation/Acceptance will include notably the order number, basic information on the purchased Products,
                confirmation of the price and the shipping address.
            </p>
            <p>
                4.9. Once you receive the Order Acceptance you can no longer cancel or
                modify your order unless otherwise provided in these General Terms.
                Dispatched Products can however be returned as set out in Article 8 below.
            </p>
            <p>
                4.10. From time to time we may invite you to pre-order certain selected Products on the Website
                before they are available to purchase from the stores or the Website (“Pre-Order Products”).
                The thirty (30) days delivery term set out in Section­ 6.4 will not apply to Pre-Order Products.
                An estimated delivery date for the Pre-Order Products will be communicated to you when we confirm your order.
